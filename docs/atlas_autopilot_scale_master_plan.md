- PR-ATLAS-SCALE-80: out-of-order architecture checkpoint (docs/manifest/tests only; Vue migration plan + autonomous-first UI policy)
- PR-ATLAS-SCALE-81

Current implementation PR:
- PR-ATLAS-SCALE-82: Patch transaction and rollback metadata foundation

Next implementation PR:
- PR-ATLAS-SCALE-83: Risk classification gate foundation

Known Current Code Facts:
- PR-78 added ThinUI contract tests and manifest-driven UI smoke.
- PR-79 defined autonomous execution readiness policy.
- PR-81 adds workspace snapshot / restore foundation.
- Snapshot artifacts are stored under resolved data_root.
- Path("ca_data") direct writes remain forbidden.
- Restore is manual-only.
- Automatic rollback remains disabled.
- Autonomous execution remains disabled.
- Atlas remains Level 0 manual-only execution at runtime.
- Autonomous execution remains forbidden until readiness gates pass.
- Required gates include snapshot/restore, patch transaction, risk classification, allowlisted verification, dry-run/approval, rollback readiness, artifact capture, stop/kill switch, loop bounds, remote git restrictions, and self-improvement gates.
- PR-79 does not enable auto-execution.
- PR-79 does not change runtime behavior.
- Primary CTA remains single existing manual action only.
- EXECUTE ONE ACTION remains required.
- Dry-run-first remains required.
- Suggested commands are not executed automatically.
- Backend workflow state remains authoritative.
- ThinUI remains replaceable and CLI-compatible.
- PR-80 remains an out-of-order architecture checkpoint and does not imply PR-79 was previously complete.
- Atlas final goal remains a fully autonomous code agent.
- Self-improving CodeAgentPersonal / KasaneCore remains explicitly in scope.

# Atlas Autopilot Scale Master Plan

## PR-73 Status
- Checkpoint/consolidation PR only.
- Align docs/roadmap/contracts for ThinUI readiness while preserving autonomous-code-agent objective.

## Near-term Plan
- PR-74: Minimal Atlas Workflow UI shell.
- PR-75〜80: Advanced/Diagnostics separation and ThinUI readiness architecture checkpoints.
- No execution semantics changes during this sequence unless explicitly policy-approved.

## Future Autonomous Plan
- PR-81+ continues autonomous execution milestones (snapshot/restore, transaction, policy-gated auto loops, self-improvement guardrails).


- Historical quality gate reference: PR-ATLAS-DOCS-QUALITY-GATE-01.
- Historical quality marker: PR-ATLAS-SCALE-65B.

- Diagnostics remain accessible through toggles and are hidden by default, not removed.

## PR-76C Checkpoint Notes

- PR-76C fixes Diagnostics drawer structure after PR-76B.
- Diagnostics drawer is structurally bounded and does not wrap minimal workflow surfaces.
- Diagnostics section IDs exist and are manifest-covered.
- Raw JSON/result panels are diagnostics surfaces.
- Direct subsystem tools are diagnostics surfaces.
- Low-level ID fields are diagnostics surfaces where practical.
- PR-80 remains an out-of-order architecture checkpoint and does not imply PR-77〜79 are complete.
- Backend workflow state is authoritative.
- Execution semantics remain unchanged.
- EXECUTE ONE ACTION remains required for manual execution.
- Dry-run-first remains required.


- PR-77 adds workflow state machine UI for the automation-first shell.
- Workflow primary CTA is derived from existing state.
- Primary CTA may trigger at most one existing manual action per click.
- Primary CTA does not auto-continue.
- Primary CTA does not execute all.
- Primary CTA does not bypass dry-run-first.
- Primary CTA does not bypass EXECUTE ONE ACTION.
- Backend workflow state remains authoritative.
- ThinUI remains replaceable and CLI-compatible.
- PR-80 remains an out-of-order architecture checkpoint and does not imply PR-79 is complete.
- Atlas final goal remains a fully autonomous code agent.
- Self-improving CodeAgentPersonal / KasaneCore remains explicitly in scope.
- Execution semantics remain unchanged.
